#Assignment

- Create a 4 page pizza place website, design is up to you
	- homepage -> listing some products, add call to action section (like order now), anything creative
	- about page -> use some of the tags we learned to display some info about the pizza place -> owner, history etc
	- pizzas page -> make a table with pizza, ingredients and prices
	- contact page -> add a contact form and an order form
	- pages must be linked to each other -> navigation has to be functional.
- Use external stylesheet (style.css)
- Use semantic tags
- Collaborate on slack, ask me or the awesome colleagues that already did websites before.
- Have fun!
