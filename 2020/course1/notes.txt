# About the course:
- each course 1h/1.5h basic syntax, 1h course project, the rest for explications
- mostly practical -> no ppt slides, based on live coding
- classes are linked, don't skip classes
- the code written during the course will be available to you after the course ends
- strongly encourage you to join the Slack channel. 
- evaluation is done in the last session. You will have to build in class a project on a given theme with the technologies learned in this course.

# About Web Development
- front end : html, css, javascript
- back end: php, java, python, c# etc. 
- full stack -> ninjas..

# About HTML

- Valid html formats .html / .htm (oldschool but still used)
- HTML5 only -> don't bother to look into older versions
- you will not learn html in 5 minutes/1 hour/1 session -> learn by practice ... so practice home
- hypertext markup language -> used for creating html documents -> lacks logic therefor is not a programming language
- building blocks of the web -> it might be more important than the programming language powering the site
- it's hard to get jobs with only html/css but it's still possible to make money with it -> example: theme development, pure front end guy
- to write it you need a text editor(sublime, atom, visual studio code, notepad++, textmate) 
- to display it you need a web browser (hopefully not IE.. IE it's bad ... mkaay!?)
- you don't need a server but to display it on the web you need a http server
- index.html -> root of the site -> web servers can be configured to serve different names of the root of the website but all will serve by default index.html
 ex. http://my-site.fr/ -> will access index.html in the webroot of my-site.fr / to access a different page http://my-site.fr/contact.html will access contact.html in the webroot

# Course 1 Notes

with what you learn in this first course you can create a STATIC website.. an ugly one.. but nevertheless a usable one. HTML without CSS it's plain ugly

## Html tags: -> building blocks of the web page
 Tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets; normally come in pairs(start tag and end tag)
    
    <tagname>content</tagname>
    ex. <h1>About</h1>
    
    !!!! don't forget to close tags !!!!

    we can have self closing tags: <br /> -> remnant of XHTML -> older version of HTML but still accepted
    <br> -> this will work in HTML5
    
## Html doc structure:

  - think of a html page as a human being.. head info is private, body is the appearance, CSS is the clothes and makeup
 
 <!DOCTYPE html> -> tells the version of HTML -> this one tells us we are using HTML5 
 <html>
    <head>
        information about the page: description, keywords, title etc
    </head>
    <body>
        actual page
    <body>
 </html>

## Ctrl + U will show the page source in browser, F12 will open the console
 
## Type of HTML tags:
    - inline -> do not start a new line; take only the necessary width (<span> <img> <a>)
    - block -> start a new line; take full width available (<div> <h1> - <h6> <p> <form>)

## Main bullets to take from this course:
p -> with strong, b, em
divs
semantic tags
links
lists
tables -> never use tables for layouts just for tabular data
forms

## All browsers have their own default styling

## Tag Attributes:
    - all tags can have attributes
    - they provide information about an element
    - placed in the FIRST tag
    - key/val pair (id="myId")
    - you can use single or double quotes -> doesn't matter
 
    <tagname attributename="attributevalue"> content </tagname>
    ex. <img src="img.jpg" title="self portrait" alt="me in the picture" />

 HTML5 Semantic Tags
  - clearly describes it's meaning/role to the browser and the developer
  - they are:
  <header>, <footer>, <aside>, <main>, <article>, <nav>, <section>, <details>
  
  LEARN THEM and most important USE THEM
  
  ex.:
    <main>
        <header>
        </header>
        
        <section>
            <article>
                <details>
                </details>
            </article>
        </section>
            
        <aside>
            <nav>
            </nav>
        </aside>
        
        <footer>
        </footer>
    </main>

## Forms
-> starts and ends with <form> tag
-> neeed to specify the action of the form
-> you can have any type of markup inside of a form, tables, divs, semantic tags etc
-> in html we can just show the form but we do not add any functionality
-> `name` attribute really important if you want the form to do something
-> we can have basic NAIVE validation inside a browser -> to be avoided.. or at least don't rely on it
-> we can have multiple input types: text, email, phone, radio, checkbox, submit, textarea, selects
-> labels can be linked using `for` tag so we can activate the input by clicking on the label

## Basic CSS
## How to add CSS
- inline -> directly in html -> not recommended for the most part (there will be occasions when it's ok-> like using js frameworks)
- internal -> using <style> tags -> you can add directly in the page (also not really recommended)
- external -> linking external .css file -> all the cool kids use it
  * presentation and styling should be always a separate part of the app

##CSS selectors

selector    property    value   

   a     {  background: red;  }
