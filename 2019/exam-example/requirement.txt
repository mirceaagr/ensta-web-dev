Your web app will have to manage a collection of cars and will have to describe your car business.
A car entity will have a brand (string), a model (string), fabrication year (number), price (number), km (number), an engine (Engine class) and a short description(description) field.
Engine class will have the following fields: fuel type(string), power(number), fuel consumption(number)
The application will implement bootstrap 3 framework

1 - Create a new angular car app using angular cli (0.5p) --
2 - Your app will have 3 pages -> home(dashboard), cars page and report page. 
    Create the needed components and use routing to create navigation between them (1p)--
3 - Create the car class/model using typescript (0.5p) --
4 - Create the engine class/model using typescript (0.5p) --
5 - Create the components needed for listing a hardcoded list of cars, which you will have to create. (1p) --
6 - Create a component to add a car in the previously hardcoded list using a service and angular forms (template or reactive, it is your choice) (1p) --
7 - Create a json server to store the cars (1p) --
8 - Replace the hardcoded list with the server using angulars HTTPClient (1p)
9 - Implement the edit/delete functionalities for the car list (1p)
10 - Implement validation for the forms -> 
    every field will be required, 
    max power for the car engine is 100, 
    max length for the brand and model is 50 chars (1.5p)
If you implement steps 1 to 10, you get 9 out of 10 possible points. In order to get MAX grade you have to also implement one of the following:

# For MAX grade one of the following:

- Implement a report page that will display the total value of the cars, the oldest car in the fleet, the most used car in the fleet and the most fuel efficient car
OR
- Store the brands and models in the json server and populate the form lists dinamically (brand and model will become selects with predefined values)
OR
- Use reactive forms instead of template forms and hide fuel consumption in case the fuel type is electric
(1p)
* Time to complete 2.5 hours. The students have access to internet and the course materials.
Max Grade: 10 points;
