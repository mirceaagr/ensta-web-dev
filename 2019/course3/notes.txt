## What is PHP
- Programming language (unlike HTML and CSS)
- It's the most used backend language for web development
* For backend development you could use whatever language you like : Python, Java, C# etc

## How to use PHP.
- You need a server that can handle PHP : Apache or Tomcat
- PHP code should not be visible in the page source.
- You can embed PHP code in the HTML or the other way around
- Php code starts with <?php and ends with ?>

## Variables
- Variables start with `$`
- Variable names are case sensitive
- Variables get a data type when they receive a value (on the assignment time)
- There are superglobals variables like : $_SESSION, $_SERVER, $_POST, $_GET and more


## Data types and operators
- Data types can be strings, integer, float(double), Array, Object and so on.
- Strings can be concatenated using `.`
- constants can be created with `define`
- as any other programming language you can do all forms of arithmetics + - / * %
- you can do increment/decrement in postfix/sufix way with ++ -- += -=
- you can cast to different types
- comparison operators: == > < >= <=

## Conditionals
- if elseif else statements
- switch

## Loops:
- while
- for
- do while
- foreach -> for array iterations
- you can nest conditionals inside iterations
- break will stop the current iteration of the loop
- die() and exit() will stop the execution of the php script

## Arrays:
- Arrays are data types that are used to store collections of data
- they store the data using key value pairs values
- Arrays can be indexed, associative,  multidimensional
- To create an array you use the array() function or the shorthand []
- To iterate through an array you can use loops but the most used type of loop is foreach
- Arrays can be sorted, manipulated, merged etc.

## Submiting forms:
- Forms can be submited via POST, GET, PUT, DELETE request types.
- All of them are the same when it comes to security.. all of them can be intercepted.
- GET has also limit in the term of the informations it can handle -> max 2000 chars
- GET should never be used to send sensitive informations
- GET and POST requests will create an associative array with the content of the form/
